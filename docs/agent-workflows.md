# Agent Workflows

## Choose a workflow

Ordinary interactive work may use the caller's current checkout. The supervising
agent owns task decomposition, native-subagent delegation, integration, and
verification.

Use `code-polishy task-session` when the caller requests isolation or when an
unattended bounded task benefits from a disposable worktree. Select every
allowed module and exact artifact path before the worker starts.

## Interactive work

Run exact tests while editing and `code-polishy test --changed` when broader
feedback is useful. At a merge checkpoint, run one
`code-polishy merge-gate --base <merge-target>` for the unchanged final
candidate. Run `code-polishy test --supplemental` only when the caller or a
checked-in workflow requires that separate hardening stage.

Commit all completed task-owned changes after required verification unless the
caller explicitly requests an uncommitted handoff. Keep each commit coherent
and free of unrelated user work. Push, publish, and pull-request operations
require the caller's explicit authorization.

## Agent reviews

Bind a requested or required agent review to an explicit trusted base and exact
candidate. A dirty-worktree review covers committed, staged, unstaged, and
untracked changes so it cannot miss candidate state.

Keep structured evidence in the task's review record. Report actionable
findings or one concise no-findings outcome to the user; omit empty sections,
machine sentinels, and duplicates of automated checks. Distinguish repository
contract concerns from requested-outcome concerns and tie each finding to its
source instruction or objective and affected file or hunk. Agent review is
non-deterministic evidence and does not replace policy checks or human approval.

## Isolated task sessions

A task session executes one worker command in a disposable Git worktree:

```sh
code-polishy task-session \
  --module application \
  --module documentation \
  --promote \
  -- WORKER [ARG...]
```

Before the worker starts, the session freezes the trusted base, caller-selected
edit boundary, exact release executable, worker command, and governed command
environment. It validates committed, staged, unstaged, deleted, renamed, and
untracked paths against that boundary.

The worker may use runner-native subagents. The supervising worker owns their
scope, integration, commits, and quiescence. Every subagent operates in the same
worktree and task boundary. `CODE_POLISHY_TASK_SESSION=1` forbids nested task
sessions.

`--promote` fast-forwards the unchanged clean source branch only after the
worker exits successfully with a clean committed candidate inside the frozen
boundary. The session stores its receipt, command log, boundary report, and any
rejected patch outside the repository. An interruption or workspace-identity
failure retains the worktree for manual inspection.

Task sessions provide isolation and path enforcement. The worker remains
responsible for implementation quality, tests, and any requested independent
review.
